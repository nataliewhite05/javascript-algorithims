//If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
//Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

//Solution
//Variable for the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5
var sum=0;
//Start with 1, divide it by 3 and 5, see if it is a whole number, continue up to 1000.
//From 1 to 1000
//a++ means a= a+1
for (var a=1; a<1000; a++)
{
      //Divide by 3
      //if its whole number
      if (a%3==0)
      {
        //then add to the sum and 
        //go to the next number
            sum+=a;
            console.log (sum);
      //if not divide by 5
      } else if (a%5==0)
        //If a whole number
      {   //add to sum
           sum+=a;
           console.log (sum);
        //if not go to the next number
      }
}
